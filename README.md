📊 Excited to share my latest project with Microsoft Power BI! 🚀

As part of my ongoing journey with the PwC Power BI Virtual Internship, I had the fantastic opportunity to work on a compelling data analysis and visualization project - PhoneNow Call Centre Trends! 📞💼

The project began with unclean and unorganized data, and I knew that rigorous data cleaning and analysis was the key to releasing the full potential of the data. I spent a lot of time ensuring the data's quality, accuracy, and completeness, which allowed me to establish the groundwork for insightful conclusions.
Once the data was clean and organized, I dived into the world of Data Visualization and Data Presentation. The goal was to create a dashboard that could provide precise insights and a comprehensive overview of the call center's performance.

🔍 Some of the highlights of the insights include:
✅ Performance rate for each agent: Understanding how each agent is performing is crucial to optimizing the call centre's efficiency and customer satisfaction.
✅ Average satisfaction rating: Customer satisfaction is the backbone of any successful call centre, and this metric helped us gauge how well we were meeting their needs.
✅ Average call answer speed: Speedy response times are essential for delivering exceptional customer service, and this metric allowed us to track our performance in real-time.
✅ Number of answered calls: By keeping a close eye on this metric, we could ensure we had the capacity to handle all incoming calls effectively.
✅ Most common issues: Identifying the most frequently called-for issues allowed us to address them proactively and improve overall customer experience.

The power of Microsoft Power BI made it possible for me to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that presented the data in a visually appealing manner. It offered a seamless experience for exploring and drilling down into the data for deeper insights.

I am incredibly proud of the outcome of this project and how it empowers decision-makers at PhoneNow to make data-driven decisions for the betterment of their call centre operations.
